# Jquery Include HTML
A better way to include documents when using HTML.

# What is this?
It's a rewrite of W3Schools' "Include HTML" script but mine utilizes Jquery.

# Requirements
- Brain
- Jquery 3.7.0 (With workarounds and modifications it can be used even with Jquery 1.6.2!)

# Known issues
- Scripts located in the included document (for example a dropdown menu) will break when the document gets parsed by the DOM and won't function as expected.
